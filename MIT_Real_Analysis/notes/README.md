In this page, I will write down important axioms and proofs in real analysis.
Most of the proofs will be based on [Understanding Analysis](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-2712-8) by Stephen Abbott and [Analysis I, II](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-7261-4) by Terence Tao
