# Groups, Rings, and Fields

## Group
A **group** is a set \( G \) equipped with a binary operation \( \cdot \) that satisfies the following properties:
1. **Closure**: For all \( a, b \in G \), \( a \cdot b \in G \).
   \[
   \forall a, b \in G, \, a \cdot b \in G
   \]
2. **Associativity**: For all \( a, b, c \in G \),
   \[
   (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)
   \]
3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element \( e \in G \) such that for all \( a \in G \),
   \[
   a \cdot e = e \cdot a = a
   \]
4. **Inverse Element**: For every \( a \in G \), there exists an element \( b \in G \) such that
   \[
   a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e
   \]
where \( e \) is the identity element.

If the group operation is commutative, i.e.,
\[
a \cdot b = b \cdot a \quad \forall a, b \in G,
\]
the group is called an **abelian group**.

---

## Ring
A **ring** is a set \( R \) equipped with two binary operations, usually called addition \( + \) and multiplication \( \cdot \), such that:
1. \( (R, +) \) is an abelian group (with additive identity \( 0 \)).
   \[
   \forall a, b, c \in R, \, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c), \quad a + 0 = a, \quad \text{and} \quad a + (-a) = 0
   \]
2. \( (R, \cdot) \) is a semigroup (i.e., associative).
   \[
   \forall a, b, c \in R, \, (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)
   \]
3. **Distributive Laws**: For all \( a, b, c \in R \),
   \[
   a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c, \quad \text{and} \quad (a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c
   \]

If \( R \) also satisfies:
- \( \cdot \) is commutative,
- \( R \) has a multiplicative identity \( 1 \neq 0 \),

then \( R \) is called a **commutative ring with identity**.

---

## Field
A **field** is a commutative ring \( F \) with identity \( 1 \neq 0 \), such that every nonzero element \( a \in F \) has a multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in F \), satisfying
\[
a \cdot a^{-1} = 1
\]

In other words, a field satisfies the following:
1. \( (F, +) \) is an abelian group:
   \[
   \forall a, b, c \in F, \, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c), \quad a + 0 = a, \quad \text{and} \quad a + (-a) = 0
   \]
2. \( (F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot) \) is an abelian group:
   \[
   \forall a, b \in F \setminus \{0\}, \, a \cdot b = b \cdot a, \quad \text{and} \quad a \cdot a^{-1} = 1
   \]
3. Multiplication distributes over addition:
   \[
   \forall a, b, c \in F, \, a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c
   \]

Examples of fields include \( \mathbb{Q} \) (rational numbers), \( \mathbb{R} \) (real numbers), and \( \mathbb{C} \) (complex numbers).
